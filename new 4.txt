Clustered Index
There can be only one clustered index for a table.
Usually made on the primary key.
The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the data pages.

Non-Clustered Index
There can be only 249 non-clustered indexes for a table(till sql version 2005 later versions support upto 999 non-clustered indexes).
Usually made on the any key.
The leaf node of a nonclustered index does not consist of the data pages. Instead, the leaf nodes contain index rows.

Clustered Index
Only one clustered index can be there in a table
Sort the records and store them physically according to the order
Data retrieval is faster than non-clustered indexes
Do not need extra space to store logical structure

Non Clustered Index
There can be any number of non-clustered indexes in a table
Do not affect the physical order. Create a logical order for data rows and use pointers to physical data files
Data insertion/update is faster than clustered index
Use extra space to store logical structure

Clustered Indexes

Clustered Indexes are faster for retrieval and slower for insertion and update.
A table can have only one clustered index.
Don't require extra space to store logical structure.
Determines the order of storing the data on the disk.
Non-Clustered Indexes

Non-clustered indexes are slower in retrieving data and faster in insertion and update.

A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

Require extra space to store logical structure.

Has no effect of order of storing data on the disk.
